Today, 2/21, TCAP rewards have been extended. \
\
10,000 CTX has been added to the TCAP Uniswap v3 pool for the next 3 months. \
\
This extension comes from the core contributor multi-sig earmarked since genesis for such rewards and not from the Cryptex DAO treasury, which remains locked and only accessible via the passing of on-chain votes by the community and its protocol delegates. \
\
Voting CTX is currently at 940,783 CTX governance delegations. \
